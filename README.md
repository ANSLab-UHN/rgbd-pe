# README
This repository contains code related to the work presented in: "The Effect of Depth Data and Physical Impairment on Lightweight Monocular RGB Human Pose Estimation Models"


## 1. Datasets
Contains code and information on how to obtain and post-process the CMU Panoptic and Human3.6M 3D human pose estimation datasets. See README files in individual folders for specific instructions.

The SUD dataset is private and not available for public use.

## 2. Models
Contains model backbones, data, and model files as well as image loaders. See README files in the folder for specific instructions.

## 3. Requirements files
Contains the requirement files for each virtual environment.

All virtual environments were created using venv, Python3.8.10.
